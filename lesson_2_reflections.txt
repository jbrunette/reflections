What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it tells git to begin tracking changes to the directory and its files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area tells git which files from the working directory we want to commit.  it allows us to selectively choose which
changes we want to commit to the repository.
